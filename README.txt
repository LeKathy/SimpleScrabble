Implementations:

Assignment’s Objective: The goal of this assignment is to create a simple, 
sample version of the iconic game scrabble.

Features implemented that works:
In this assignment, from the start of the site, the tiles are shuffled upon
 starting the game. The user is to drag and drop the letters from the rack 
to the single line point keeper. That feature is made possible, that the 
letters could be drag and dropped into the according box with the special 
space that calculates the scores of the words spelled. The single line can 
also detect and recognize the letters placed and reiterate the spelled word 
and the worth of score values to the player. The scores are accurate. Players 
may also start a new game and restart with the implemented “New Game” button. 
Once the word has been created, the player may submit the word, to record 
their points and clear the single line board, and new letters would be placed 
on the rack. As those happen, the game also accounts for the numbers of tiles 
remaining, too. When the tiles are less than 7, the player is made aware that 
there are less than 7. The scrabble game also makes sure that the player can
 retract their tiles, or if dropped in areas that are not registered to be 
played on the aboard, the tile goes back onto the rack.

Missing feature:
The missing feature or the implementation I can’t work out is the one where
 tiles MUST be next to each other, else the tiles are retracted back to the 
rack. But right now, the tiles can be in any order and the scores can be 
tallied to the highest point worth if players play it accordingly.
